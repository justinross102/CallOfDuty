# CallOfDuty

One of life's most desperately desired achievements is a win in Call of Duty. As such, our goal in this analysis is to determine the factors that contribute to success in online multiplayer matches. The data for our analysis was collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aishahakami/call-of-duty-players), and contains a number of variables relating to player performance.

Our group repository includes python files from each member of our group with the code used to complete our analysis. We all ran different models and experimented with different ideas so that we could all contribute to answering our primary research question. We also have a copy of our final written report along with csv files that show the results of our cluster analysis.
